                    <p>Sun Dream’s career in music making began in 2015 when his neighbor threw away some kind of knock off of a hammond organ. It was huge, warm and intensely fun. Living with his parents, he converted the garage into a makeshift studio using trash, cheap and otherwise acquired gear. It was easy to find inspiration in the act of creation using whatever was available, which led to the revolutionary discipline of recording songs using a looper and Voice Memos on iPhone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After recording and listening to voice memos on his own, he thought of uploading them to Bandcamp so they became more available to listen to - purely for himself. Sure, they were public, but he was the audience. Embracing mistakes and imperfections in his art made for a unique blend of experimental indie songs that change genre from album to album. 
                       </p>
                    <p><em>Noxitanous Remains</em> is what he considers his debut project - the rest being public b-sides. Even in the demos, we can see the DNA that made this dungeon synth-inspired project come to life. Pulling songs from across his discography, we are entranced with a dark, ambient soundscape backed by whispers of worldbuilding. Exposition is front-loaded with a spoken word track that drops you in a fantasy post apocalyptic setting; a world where catastrophic events such as the Ultraviolet Shift have pushed earth’s population to its breaking point. The rest of the instrumentals merely hint at what remains in this environment. </p>
                    <p>
                        It is hard to pin down an exact style or genre Sun Dream fits into; it depends on the song. <em>Mistakes</em> from the <em>Fine Demo</em> or <em>Wasting Time</em> from <em>stickerpack</em> are very clearly tapped into the punk ethos while <em>Vaporized Cassette</em> pays homage to Vaporwave influences like Macintosh Plus or 4departing4. <em>Am I Yours Too</em> is an obvious love letter to Beach House , he even says so in the music video / visualizer. 
                        
                       </p> 
                    <p>Look forward to the upcoming Sun Dream release this Halloween ; an EP dedicated to the brutal nature of being alive.

                    <p>Sun Dream signed to Auralithic Records in 2025. </p>
                    <p>Spotify is the least complete catalog of Sun Dream songs, for now at least.</p>

                    <p> Bandcamp is the most complete archive of Sun Dream recordings.</p>
                    <p> For a good chunk of time, an EP release was simply releasing the demos that have amalgamated on his phone, letting these go in order to move on to the next project.</p>
                    <p> For Newcomers: Begin with <em>Noxitanous Remains</em>, then move to <em>CLAY</em>, <em>FINE DEMO</em> and then end on <em>emptyphone</em>. This will give you the widest range of Sun Dream songs.</p>
                    <p>Moving forward, only official recordings will be on Bandcamp. Keeping the old recordings as a historical record shows how far he's come. </p>
