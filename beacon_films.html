                     <p>Beacon Films has been on youtube under many names before, unfortunately those channels are lost to time - forgotten and deleted.  This time, he’s not letting anyone tell him different. Beacon Films is part vlog - part storytelling. We learn more about the mindset of Cristian Barraza; who he is, what he does and how he thinks. </p>
                     <p>One video that encapsulates his channel is the Volvo 240 movie. You can go back into his channel and see a video that showcases how fun the car is for him and why he loves it, despite its flaws; a brilliant juxtaposition against the ad he made to sell the car. He made the video to accompany a facebook marketplace ad; not being satisfied with only 10 pictures to sell what was his favorite car. Even comments on reddit were confused, asking “This is a lot of effort to advertise a sell for a car that you claim was your favorite. Why?”. It was a love letter to send off the vehicle in style. Not just doomed to be forgotten in a marketplace ad once it sold. </p>
                     <p>We follow Cristian in his problem solving ventures, some made up, others necessary. It’s a vital part of his work to have a message behind what he does. Vlogging daily life isn’t interesting if nothing is going on, so finding a reason to do something is what fuels his movies. 

                        As a peek into his history making movies, he compiled a playlist of Video Flyers he made for Sister Fisters, a drag talent agency in Austin, TX. This is where he birthed his VHS-like style for editing. Valentine Quarantine is his favorite, with A Tribute to The Strokes | This is It being a close second. Keen-eyed fans will recognize that he is the lead singer of the now disbarred Strokes tribute band. 
                        </p>
                     <p>Cristian Barraza is a Visual Thinker, meaning he thinks using pictures, rotating cubes and putting images to words. “How can I make my vision come to life?” In his 3-part movie Repairs, Bags and Pink Crocs, we see his encounter with a backyard gate that isn’t broken, but could use fixing. Jay Jones’ Desk Stand goes deeper into visualizing his thought process, showing the diagrams that eventually birth a physical desk stand, a gift for his best friend.  When he goes on lectures like in Intermediate Fortnite Tips and Tricks or A Cinematic Move about Tape, he always accompanies the narration with a visual of the problem that needs solving and how to fix it. </p>

                    <p>This is where the VHS-like aesthetic was born, embracing mistakes, imperfections and natural degradation.</p>

                    </h3>
                    <p>There are times that a topic warrants a full on exploration and lecture. This lecture on why Home Depot is an art store got a lot of engagement regarding defying expectations. </p>
                    <p>or, the lecture on Intermediate Fortnite Tips & Tricks broke into the playstyle he has for Fortnite. Somewhat of a recommendation, mostly an exploration. </p>
